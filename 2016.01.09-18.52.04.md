If there is one book you should read if you are passionate about your job, your position as a leader and if you are a strong advocate of open source, it's [Jim's book][redhat].
First I raced through it in a few hours. It left me behind full of new cool ideas how to become better at the stuff I am doing currently.

Reading it for the third time now. Slower. Even more enganged.

Eye opening. Exhilarating.

Stay safe.
