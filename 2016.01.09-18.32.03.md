Problem:

After I've installed Xubuntu 14.04LTS on a HP250 laptop, wifi stopped working.

Error log showed 

<code>kernel: [  400.817365] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00queue_flush_queue: Warning - Queue 0 failed to flush</code>

Fix:

Original drivers for the "Ralink corp. RT3290 Wireless 802.11n" device are closed source and the open source spin-off is broken in Xubuntu.

Unfortunatelly you need to install the closed source drivers.

Download from my [Amazon Drive][1].

<code>
1.) Extraxt rt3290sta-2.6.0.0 into /usr/src
2.) Run "dkms install -m rt3290sta -v 2.6.0.0 --force"
3.) Reboot.
</code>

You should be fine now.

Stay safe.
