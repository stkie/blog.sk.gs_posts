My entire career is build on [FOSS][1]. Here is why I love it so much.

- It's free. Free as in free beer. Yay.
- It's open source. Open source means, everyone can look at the software core itself and sift through to hunt for bugs and security flaws. More people == less risks.
- You can build amazing things at little to no cost.
- Chances are, that there is an open source alternative for every closed source software you run right at this moment.
- People are able to contribute, ideas never stall.
- Open source is for everyone.
- FOSS helps people protecting their privacy.
- Entire virtual landscapes and real [businesses][3] are build on open source software.
- It promotes honesty and friendship.
- FOSS brings down dictatorship and fights [tyranny][2].
- It benefits everyone.
