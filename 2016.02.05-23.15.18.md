Your server by default displays information via Apache and PHP that makes it vulnerable.
With Apache, the version number and installed module versions are listed at the bottom of 404 error pages.
With PHP, it adds the ‘powered-by’ information and displays the version number.
Both cases are not desirable as attackers can use such information to compromise the server.

How to fix this? Simple.

In your <b>httpd.conf</b> change <b>ServerSignature</b> and <b>ServerTokens</b> to

<code>
ServerSignature Off
</code><br />
<code>
ServerTokens Prod
</code>

and in your <b>php.ini</b> disable expose_php.

<code>
expose_php = Off
</code>

Don’t forget to restart your webserver to let the changes take effect.

Done.
